    "**In this notebook, we walk through how to fine-tune MMoCHi's in-house landmark registration function. This fine-tuning is critical for obtaining well-integrated ADT data. Here, we will focus primarily on correcting landmark detection, as the position of identified landmarks defines how the expression distributions are shifted.**\n",

    "A note before we begin: landmark registration of ADT data can also be achieved using [ADTnorm in R](https://github.com/yezhengSTAT/ADTnorm) or the [Python wrapper for it](https://github.com/donnafarberlab/ADTnormPy). The functions shown here are specifically designed to work with our in-house landmark registration function, but the concepts described can be applied to any landmark registration based tool."

Landmark registration removes batch effects caused by variable background and signal-to-noise ratio of antibody staining and variable sequencing depth, thus samples that were stained or sequenced separately should be treated as separate batches. In this case, staining was performed separately for each of the sequencing runs.
